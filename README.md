:rocket: This is the official repository of Generalized Lightness Adaptation with Channel Selective Normalization (ICCV 2023). 

**Our approach purposely normalizes the statistics of lightness-relevant channels and keeps other channels unchanged, so as to improve feature generalization and discrimination.**

We will provide the code used for this work. If you find this paper useful, please :star:star this repo  and :page_facing_up:cite our paper .
